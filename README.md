# EatDa-Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, you simply need to add the burger to your burger list and this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured!
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not, and then displays it to the 
page when it is called upon.  

So Awesome!
Enjoy this fun app.
